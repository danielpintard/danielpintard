- 👋 Hi, I am Daniel Pintard. I am currently a 4th year undergraduate at Marymount University (1 semester left! grad Dec 2025). My home country is The Bahamas 🇧🇸.
- 👀 I’m interested in biology, particularly molecular biology and computational biology. So far, my expertise includes Single Cell Transcriptome analysis, and I am super eager to look into different omics datasets. Specifically, I am currently interested in studying protein structure and protein-protein interactions. 
- 🌱 I have been working with Python for over 2 years now, and have experience with libraries such as scanpy, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, just to name a few. I also have acquired experience with R, utilizing packages such as Seurat, SingleCellExpreriment and others related to single cell NGS analysis. I also have experience with working with BASH and Linux in High Performance Computing systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bioinformatics/computational biology projects and even data science projects within other scientific disciplines.
